# Homion - The Taste of Home

The main idea behind our project is to serve people who are craving for the dishes that they
cannot make on their own and even they don't want to eat those dishes made in restaurant,
and so we came up with the idea that those people can still satisfy their craving from the
dishes that are neither made on their own nor from the restaurant. Those people can call
the verified chefs from the nearby area through the app straight to their home to prepare
that dish for the user. The chefs can also deliver the dishes made by them to the user who
has requested it. The app will have many other features like inbuilt chat option, payment
gateway and many more to ease the whole process.
